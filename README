Original README file has been moved to the README.upstream file.

This repository contains the SELinux Reference Policy patched to make it work on
Debian sid. Patches here are *NOT* intented to be merged upstream as-is but must
need some work to be clean up/verified. If you intend to improve current policy,
please work from http://oss.tresys.com/git/refpolicy.git or
http://oss.tresys.com/git/refpolicy-contrib.git instead of this
repository.

Information about SELinux Reference Policy can be found on its project page:
http://oss.tresys.com/projects/refpolicy

This version has a patched build.conf which makes a Debian build named
"refpolicy-patched". To install it, run "make install".

policy/modules/contrib is a git submodule to the contrib branch of this repo.
